Hi, I'm Scott, a cabinetmaker / carpenter living in Berlin , originally from Canada. I specialize in installing home units (kitchens, bathrooms, closets etc.), small renovation projects and custom builds. Soon to be tri-lingual (English, French and basic German) I am experienced in many aspects of European construction and installation. When I'm not freelancing here in Berlin, I am frequently contracted to work on yacht interiors in ports around the world.

Here's a cute picture of my dog - _Cassidy_
